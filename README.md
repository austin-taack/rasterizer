# CPU Rasterizer

<p> This project is a simple renderer that uses rasterization on the CPU.
It was built from scratch using only the SDL2 library to display the synthesized images.
When the code is compiled as-is, it will generate a 3D image of a purple Utah teapot.
However, the project also includes other models to synthesize shown in the images below,
including the matching teacup and a spoon. </p>

## Images

<p>Here are some of the images I created with this rasterizer:</p>

### Utah Teapot

### Teacup
